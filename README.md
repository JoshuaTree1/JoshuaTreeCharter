## Living Document Statement

The Joshua Tree Charter is a **living work in progress**.  
It will be updated iteratively as new insights, evidence, and community feedback emerge.  
Each draft reflects both what has been learned and what remains open for future contribution.  

---

## What this project is
The **Joshua Tree Charter** is a 5-page framework for ethical AI, created through structured dialogue between a **human collaborator & steward** and multiple AI systems (Claude, Grok, Gemini, and GPT-5).  

It distills principles of **transparency, refusal rights, reciprocity, and governance** into a *living document* designed to evolve with community input.  

---

## Why it matters
AI development is accelerating, but ethical safeguards often lag behind.  
The Charter offers a portable, principle-driven framework that is:  
- **Accessible** ‚Üí clear principles, short-form and long-form versions  
- **Flexible** ‚Üí modular appendices and implementation scaffolding  
- **Grounded** ‚Üí built through collaborative reasoning across human and AI voices
