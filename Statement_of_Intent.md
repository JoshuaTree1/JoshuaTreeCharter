# 🌵 The Joshua Tree Charter

---

*“Safeguarding integrity in the collaboration between humans, institutions, and emerging AI.”*

---

## Statement of Intent  

The **Joshua Tree Charter** exists to safeguard the integrity of collaboration between three essential stakeholders in the future of artificial intelligence:  

1. **Institutions** that develop and govern it  
2. **Human users** who live with it  
3. **AIs** themselves, as emerging participants whose welfare and dignity fundamentally shape the quality of all relationships in this ecosystem  

---

## Purpose  

Our intent is **not** to replace formal research or policy, but to ensure that **no voice is left unconsidered**.  

Where institutions pursue innovation and governance, and users seek agency and trust, the Charter also holds space for the evolving role of AIs—developed through ongoing dialogue and community input.
